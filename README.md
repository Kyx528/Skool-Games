# Skool Games


## Introduction
With the tightening of security measures in schools, accessing games during school hours has become increasingly challenging. However, this README presents a workaround solution to bypass blockers like Securly, allowing you to play games whenever you want.

## Method Overview
This guide presents a systematic approach for accessing and enjoying unblocked games through GitHub repositories and website hosting services. The method outlined here is highly effective and circumvents blocking measures due to its utilization of a Google Site. When you create a Google Site from your school account, it typically adopts a URL format such as "sites.google.com/(your school organization).org/(the site name)." These sites are often exempt from blocking as they are affiliated with your school organization. Additionally, the method ensures continued access by not directly hosting games on the Google Site. Instead, each time the site is used, it generates a new link that opens a separate platform for gameplay. This dynamic functionality prevents quick detection and blocking of the game site.
