# Skool Games


## Introduction
With the tightening of security measures in schools, accessing games during school hours has become increasingly challenging. However, this README presents a workaround solution to bypass blockers like Securly, allowing you to play games whenever you want.

## Method Overview
This guide presents a systematic approach for accessing and enjoying unblocked games through GitHub repositories and website hosting services. The method outlined here is highly effective and circumvents blocking measures due to its utilization of a Google Site. When you create a Google Site from your school account, it typically adopts a URL format such as "sites.google.com/(your school organization).org/(the site name)." These sites are often exempt from blocking as they are affiliated with your school organization. Additionally, the method ensures continued access by not directly hosting games on the Google Site. Instead, each time the site is used, it generates a new link that opens a separate platform for gameplay. This dynamic functionality prevents quick detection and blocking of the game site.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Find an Unblocked Games Repository
- Search for an unblocked games on GitHub and find one that permits hosting on your preffered platform.

### Step 2: Host the Website
- Once you've identified a suitable repository, host the website on your preffered hosting service. Follow their instructions to deploy the site.

### Step 3: Create a Google Site
- Visit sites.google.com and create a new site.
- After creating the site, navigate to the embedding options.
- Choose the option to embed HTML code.

### Step 4: Embed the Game Site
- Copy the HTML code provided by the hosted game site (e.g., from Netlify).
- Paste the HTML code into the embedding section of your Google Site.
- Modify the code as necessary, such as adding your own API key.

### Step 5: Enjoy Unblocked Games
- Once the game site is embedded on your Google Site, you can access and play the games anytime, bypassing school blockers.

## Note
- If your google site keeps getting blocked download the html file which cannot be blocked. The only downside by doing this is other people will not be able to go to the site and you will have to share the file with them.
- Ensure that you comply with your school's acceptable use policy and regulations regarding internet usage.
- Use this method responsibly and only during appropriate times.
